# This config assumes there's an ingres controller set up, specifically nginx,
# and a cert manager.
#
# When you apply this config, it attempts a ACME challenge and assigns a Let's
# Encrypt certificate for the service.
#
# The ingress controller will direct all traffic coming at the external IP with
# host header "hellow.cluster.porkbrain.com" to the hellow service. Akin to
# apache's vhosts.
#
# ```
# k get svc ingress-nginx-controller
